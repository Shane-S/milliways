ABOUT THE OPTION
----------------

Thinking about choosing Data Comm? You could be a data commie if you
*   want to learn,
*   enjoy C/C++ programming,
*   manage your time (or work well with no sleep),
*   can learn concepts on your own,
and above all, you are prepared to work HARD. This option is about more than just getting a piece of paper. You will become a confident, knowledgeable and skilled software developer. Your skills
will include:
*   Low-level communications programming (with serial cables)
*   Sockets programming in C on Linux and Windows
*   In-depth knowledge of different I/O models
*   Program design and proper documentation
See below for a complete list of assignments or head to the Projects page for some examples.
